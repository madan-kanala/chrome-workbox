/**
 * NavigationRoute is a helper class to create a [`Route`]{@link Route}
 * that matches browser navigation requests, i.e. requests for a page.
 *
 * It will only match incoming requests whose [`mode`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode)
 * is set to `navigate`.
 *
 * You can optionally only apply this route to a subset of navigation requests
 * by using one or both of the `blacklist` and `whitelist` parameters. If
 * both lists are provided, and there's a navigation to a URL which matches
 * both, then the blacklist will take precedence and the request will not be
 * matched by this route. The regular expressions in `whitelist` and `blacklist`
 * are matched against the [`pathname`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/pathname)
 * portion of the requested URL.
 *
 * To match all navigations, use a `whitelist` array containing a RegExp that
 * matches everything, i.e. `[/./]`.
 *
 * @memberof module:sw-routing
 * @extends Route
 *
 * @example
 * // Any navigation requests that match the whitelist (i.e. URLs whose path
 * // starts with /article/) will be handled with the cache entry for
 * // app-shell.html.
 * const route = new goog.routing.NavigationRoute({
 *   whitelist: [new RegExp('^/article/')],
 *   handler: {handle: () => caches.match('app-shell.html')},
 * });
 *
 * const router = new goog.routing.Router();
 * router.registerRoute({route});
