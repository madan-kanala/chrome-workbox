# Getting Started

If you are completely new to service workers and sw-helpers,
the easiest place to start with `sw-cli`.

This is a command line tool that can build a service
worker that will precache the assets for your site and make it work offline.

[Learn More About sw-cli Here](./sw-cli.html#main)

If you'd like to make use of the functionality provided by these libraries
in your own service worker than `sw-lib` would be the best option for you.
