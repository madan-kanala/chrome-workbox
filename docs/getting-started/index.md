# Getting Started

If you are completely new to service workers and sw-helpers,
the easiest place to start is `sw-cli`.

This is a command line tool that will build a service
worker to precache assets for your site and make it work offline.

If you'd like to use the sw-helpers libraries, and you already have your own 
service worker, then `sw-lib` is a better option.
