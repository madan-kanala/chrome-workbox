# Welcome to Workbox

Workbox is â€¦

Section will include

* A brief def of service worker and PWAs with a links to robust documentation.
* TBD

## What does workbox do?

*A service worker in two minutes*: Use
[sw-cli](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-cli.html#main)
to add a service worker to an existing project in under two minutes.


*Build script integration*: Generate a service worker in your build process
using [sw-build](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-build.html#main).

*Go beyond the basics*: If you'd like to use the Workbox libraries, and you
already have your own service worker, then
[sw-lib](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-lib.html#main) is a better option.

*And much more*: If you've been using Workbox for a while, or you're
ambitious, you can delve into its more advanced features. Browse the
[recipes section](recipes), try the [examples](examples), or look up
something in the [mobules reference](reference-docs/stable/latest/).
