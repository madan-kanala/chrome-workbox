# Welcome to Workbox

Workbox is a suite of helper libraries for service workers and progressive web
apps. You can implement workbox features in a manner of minutes. While it's full
set of features can be used in all types and scales of web apps.

## A service worker in two minutes

Use [sw-cli](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-cli.html#main)
to add a service worker to an existing project in under two minutes.

## A build script in ten minutes

Generate a service worker in your build process
using [sw-build](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-build.html#main).

## Much more

Go beyond the basics. If you'd like to use the Workbox libraries, and you
already have your own service worker, then
[sw-lib](reference-docs/stable/latest/module-sw-lib.html#main) is a better option.

If you've been using Workbox for a while, or you're
ambitious, you can delve into its more advanced features. Browse the
[recipes section](recipes), try the [examples](examples), or look up
something in the [mobules reference](reference-docs/stable/latest/).
