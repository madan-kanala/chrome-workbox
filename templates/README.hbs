# Service Worker Helpers

A [collection of libraries](#the-libraries) that help enhance your existing
[service worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/)
by providing commonly-needed functionality.

A [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)
approach is used to manage multiple helper libraries, each of which is versioned
and published to `npm` independently.

## Development

### Existing Build Tasks

Tasks are run via [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/), and assume that you have a
globally installed `gulp` binary (`npm install -g gulp`) as well as
a locally installed set of `node_module` dependencies (`npm install` from within
the top-level directory).

When running a task, an optional `--project=project-name` parameter can be used.
For example, `gulp build:watch --project=sw-appcache-behavior`.
By default the task will be run against all projects.

### New Projects

New projects should be created as sub-directories of [projects](projects/),
following the basic layout of the existing projects. It's recommended that each
library adopts the `sw-` prefix, for consistency.

Always include the following:

- `src/` - raw source files, with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)-formatted
comments.
- `build.js` - Should `export` a function that performs all the steps needed to
produce a ready-to-use library in local `build/` directory.
- `test/*.js` - One or more [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test suites.
- `package.json` - The `npm` metadata for the library. Each library is
versioned independently.

A `demo/` directory is optional but encouraged. The project's `README.md` file
will be automatically generated based on a template using the metadata found in
the `JSDoc` comments.
